# My Work Items On Pending Changes Page for Visual Studio 2015

This is an extension for Visual Studio 2015 that makes it quick and easy to associate your TFS work items when checking in pending changes. You tell the extension what type and status of work items you want to see in the Pending Changes page, and then they magically show up for you to choose from.
